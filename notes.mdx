1. **docker run -it ubuntu**
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

Explanation:
This command tells Docker to run a new container using the Ubuntu image (a lightweight Ubuntu OS).

-i → Keeps STDIN open (interactive mode)

-t → Allocates a terminal so you can interact with the container directly

2. **docker container ls, docker container ls -a**
```bash
docker container ls
```

Explanation:
This command lists all running containers on your system.

It shows details like Container ID, Image, Command, Status, Ports, and Names.

To see all containers (including stopped ones), use:

```bash
docker container ls -a
```

Explanation:
This command lists all containers — both running and stopped ones — on your system.

-a → stands for --all, which includes containers that have exited or stopped.

It displays details like Container ID, Image, Command, Created time, Status, Ports, and Names.

📝 Use this command when you want to view every container that exists on your system, not just the active

3. **docker start/stop containerName**
```bash
docker start containerName
```

Explanation:
Starts a stopped container whose name (or ID) is containerName.
It resumes the container from its last stopped state.


```bash
docker stop containerName
```

Explanation:
Stops a running container whose name (or ID) is containerName.
This sends a signal to gracefully shut down the container.
